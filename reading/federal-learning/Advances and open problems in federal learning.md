# introduction
### federated learning
1. federated learning is a machine learning setting where many clients $\color{red}{collaboratively train a model} under the orchestration of a central server while $\color{red}{keeping the training data decentralized}.  
2. Embodies the principles of focused data collection and minimization and can mitigate many of the systemic $\color{red}{privacy risks}$ and costs resulting from traditional centralized machine learning approaches.  
### this paper
1. defining characteristics and challenges of the federated learning setting  
2. highlight important practical constraints and considerations. Enumerates a range of valuable research directions  
3. goal of this work are to highlight research problems that are of significant theoretical and practical interest
